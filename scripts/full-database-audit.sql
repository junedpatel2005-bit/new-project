-- 19 Manual verification notes
-- The migration-history query is Prisma-specific and may be absent before initialization.
-- RLS disabled is not automatically a vulnerability; verify whether direct data APIs expose the table.
-- Run this script with a role that can read catalogs and application tables.
-- Confirm PostgreSQL version support for pg_sequences, pg_policies, and pg_stat_user_tables.
