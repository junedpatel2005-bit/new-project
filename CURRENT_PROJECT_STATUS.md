# Current Project Status

## Executive Summary

Overall:

NOT PRODUCTION READY

The application currently builds, typechecks, and passes its existing 14-test unit suite. The earlier unverified-login issue is fixed in code and covered by focused tests. Revocable sessions are implemented in source but have no disposable-PostgreSQL lifecycle verification. Razorpay processing and development OTP concurrency are implemented in source, but have no disposable-PostgreSQL failure/concurrency test results. The initial Prisma migration remains empty, so fresh migration replay is not proven. Integrity and webhook-state migrations are written but not deployed or live-verified. Authorization has server-side checks in many routes, but no complete two-user negative matrix exists. Supabase/RLS, grants, backups, restore, and provider settings remain unavailable for verification.

## Progress Summary

Original Issues: 13 database issues plus cross-cutting API, auth, security, financial, transaction, concurrency, file, performance, operations, and testing issues from prior reports.  
Fixed: DB-002 (unverified standard session), DB-011 (typecheck), DB-010 (unsafe raw SQL findings in application/maintenance scripts, static review).  
Partially Fixed: DB-006/TRAN-001, DB-008, CON-001, FILE-001, API-001, DB-012.  
Implemented / Needs Verification: FIN-001, DB-003/DB-005/DB-007, webhook-state migration, MIGRATION_INTEGRITY_REVIEW, TEST-001, disposable PostgreSQL harness.  
Not Fixed: MIG-001/DB-001, MIG-002/DB-004, DB-013, API-002, SEC-001, OPS-001, CODE-001.
Unable to Verify: SUPA-001, live database contents, migration replay, provider settings, EXPLAIN plans, backup/restore.  
New Issues Found: No confirmed new production vulnerability; the review confirms that the Phase 1 financial fix lacks required integration tests and that the Phase 2 OTP fix covers only the development provider.

## Fully Fixed

### DB-002 — Unverified users do not receive standard sessions

What was wrong: Standard sessions could be issued before mandatory email verification.  
What changed: Registration and normal login return the verification-required response without issuing the normal session; session verification also checks current user state.  
Evidence: `app/api/auth/[action]/route.ts`, `src/lib/auth.ts`, and auth tests.  
Tests: Existing suite passed: 12 tests in 3 files.  
Why it is now considered fixed: The root cause is addressed in the relevant email login/registration paths and no database deployment is required for this behavior.

### DB-010 — Unsafe raw SQL findings

What was wrong: Earlier maintenance paths used unsafe raw SQL patterns.  
What changed: Current application and script scan found no executable `$executeRawUnsafe` or `$queryRawUnsafe`; parameterized `Prisma.sql` is used where raw SQL remains.  
Evidence: Repository-wide targeted scan excluding generated/docs output.  
Tests: Typecheck and build pass.  
Why it is now considered fixed: No current executable unsafe raw call was found; keep the scan as a regression check.

### DB-011 — Typecheck failure

What was wrong: Earlier schema/type drift caused typecheck failure.  
What changed: Schema relations and generated client are synchronized.  
Evidence: Current strict TypeScript configuration.  
Tests: `npm run typecheck` PASS.  
Why it is now considered fixed: The command passes without suppressions.

## Partially Fixed

### FIN-001 / TRAN-001

What has been fixed: Razorpay local event processing has explicit state, conditional claiming, retry handling, identity/amount/currency validation, and a local database transaction.  
What remains: No database-backed failure, duplicate, out-of-order, or two-request test; durable notification/event delivery is still absent.  
Risk: A code-level transaction can still regress without integration coverage or deployed migration.  
Next exact action: Add disposable PostgreSQL webhook fixtures and verify rollback/retry behavior.

### CON-001

What has been fixed: Development OTP increment/consume is one conditional parameterized update.  
What remains: Twilio provider behavior and every project/payment transition lack concurrent tests.  
Risk: Other read-then-write paths may still allow double winners.  
Next exact action: Add concurrent tests, then audit each transition for expected-state updates.

### DB-008 / FILE-001 / API-001 / DB-012

What has been fixed: Core relations, upload validation, provider signatures, and selected status guards improved.  
What remains: Legacy relation-like fields, durable file reconciliation, Razorpay age/replay policy, and free-form statuses remain.  
Risk: Static correctness may diverge from deployed schema/provider behavior.  
Next exact action: Complete the live/staging verification matrices before further broad refactoring.

## Implemented — Needs Verification

### Needs Testing

- Razorpay valid/duplicate/failure/retry/out-of-order/wrong-relationship/amount/concurrency scenarios.
- OTP concurrent correct submissions and attempt limits.
- Two-user IDOR matrix and admin boundaries.
- Constraint rejection, FK rejection, transaction rollback, and upload cleanup.
- Session revocation after logout/reset/disable.

### Needs Live DB Verification

- `MIG-001`, integrity migration, all FKs/checks/unique indexes, orphan/duplicate/money queries, RLS, policies, grants, functions, sequences, and table statistics.
- `MIG-002` fractional values and historical aggregate reconciliation.

### Needs Deployment

- `202608310001_database_integrity_guards` and `202608310002_razorpay_webhook_processing_state`.
- Do not deploy either until the empty baseline/history issue and preflight strategy are resolved.

### Needs Staging Verification

- CSP nonce/hash plan, upload private access and cleanup, query plans, runtime proxy behavior, and failure-injected workflows.

### Needs Provider Verification

- Razorpay webhook timestamps/retries/order amounts, Persona event ordering, Twilio limits, SMTP, S3 privacy, and deployment credentials.

## Still Not Fixed

ID: MIG-001 / DB-001  
Severity: CRITICAL  
Problem: Empty initial migration prevents proven fresh database creation.  
Why it remains: No deployed history/schema comparison or disposable replay.  
Production risk: Rebuild/deploy failure.  
Exact next fix: Compare target `_prisma_migrations` and schema, then create an approved replay strategy.  
Files involved: `prisma/migrations/0_init`, all migrations, `prisma/schema.prisma`.  
Tests required: Empty and upgrade database replay.

ID: MIG-002 / DB-004  
Severity: HIGH  
Problem: Historical money conversion still rounds values.  
Why it remains: No reconciliation evidence.  
Production risk: Silent financial drift.  
Exact next fix: Run read-only count/sum/fraction/min/max reconciliation.  
Files involved: `202608200005_integer_money_fields`.  
Tests required: Conversion and aggregate reconciliation.

ID: DB-009 / AUTH-001
Severity: HIGH
Problem: Session revocation was absent.
What changed: JWTs now reference a database session; logout, password reset, and account disable revoke sessions. Legacy stateless cookies require re-login after rollout.
Why it is not closed: The migration has not been replayed against disposable PostgreSQL and route-level lifecycle tests have not run.
Production risk: Deployment without the session table would break authentication; incomplete rollout validation could leave lifecycle gaps.
Exact next action: Apply the migration in the isolated test database and run copied-token, logout, reset, disable, role-change, and multi-session tests.
Files involved: `src/lib/auth.ts`, auth routes, admin users route, schema/migrations.
Tests required: Database-backed session lifecycle and route integration tests.

ID: OPS-001 / TEST-001  
Severity: HIGH  
Problem: CI does not yet provide complete restore/security verification.  
Why it remains: The temporary PostgreSQL jobs and harness are now present, but have not run in this environment and migration replay is expected to expose MIG-001.  
Production risk: Schema and authorization regressions pass CI.  
Exact next fix: Run the isolated CI jobs, retain the expected MIG-001 failure, and add restore/security gates.  
Files involved: `.github/workflows/quality.yml`, tests, Prisma config.  
Tests required: Migration, FK/check, IDOR, money, webhook, OTP, concurrency, upload, and session tests.

ID: SUPA-001  
Severity: HIGH  
Problem: Deployed RLS, grants, Storage, Realtime, and function security are unknown.  
Why it remains: No live read-only result or authoritative policy artifact.  
Production risk: Direct API or Storage cross-tenant access cannot be ruled out.  
Exact next fix: Run the read-only audit against staging and inspect provider policies.  
Files involved: `scripts/full-database-audit.sql`, deployed Supabase project.  
Tests required: anon/authenticated/service-role positive and negative access tests.

## Production Blockers

P0:

1. MIG-001: fresh migration replay is not proven because the baseline is empty.
2. Financial webhook integration/failure/retry/concurrency tests are absent.
3. Integrity migration and financial schema changes are not deployed or live-verified.

P1:

1. AUTH-001: session revocation is implemented but not database/route verified.
2. Complete IDOR/admin negative matrix is absent.
3. Durable outbox and project workflow atomicity are incomplete.
4. RLS/grants/Storage/provider configuration are unverified.
5. Historical money conversion remains unreconciled.
6. Backup/restore and rollback are not rehearsed.

P2:

1. CSP nonce/hash migration, query-plan optimization, API contract normalization, and lint cleanup.

## Exact Next Fix Order

1. Run the new disposable PostgreSQL integration infrastructure and migration diagnostic in CI.
2. Prove FIN-001 rollback, duplicate, retry, out-of-order, amount, and concurrent behavior.
3. Complete CON-001 for all project/payment transitions and add concurrent tests.
4. Run read-only migration/integrity/money preflights against a sanitized target.
5. Resolve MIG-001 using deployed migration history and schema evidence; replay from empty and upgrade states.
6. Deploy and verify integrity/webhook-state migrations in staging only after preflight succeeds.
7. Execute and verify the revocable-session migration and logout/reset/disable/token-theft behavior.
8. Add the two-user IDOR/admin matrix and run it against the real route surface.
9. Verify RLS, grants, Storage, Realtime, functions, provider webhooks, and backup/restore.
10. Address CSP, upload reconciliation, API validation, query plans, and lint warnings.

## Do Not Change Yet

- Do not edit `prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql` until deployed migration history and schema are compared.
- Do not rewrite historical financial values or rerun rounding.
- Do not deploy integrity constraints before read-only orphan/duplicate/range preflight is clean.
- Do not treat a webhook event row as processed without the processing-state fields and transaction migration deployed.
- Do not mark authorization fixed without two-user negative tests.
- Do not add speculative indexes without staging query evidence.
- Do not tighten CSP globally until payment/maps dependencies are tested in staging.

### Production Decision

STATUS: NOT PRODUCTION READY

BLOCKERS:
1. Fresh migration replay and deployed database integrity are unverified.
2. Financial atomicity and concurrency behavior lack required integration tests.
3. Session revocation, IDOR matrix, RLS/grants, and backup/restore remain unverified or incomplete.

NEXT REQUIRED ACTION:
Create a disposable PostgreSQL CI environment and prove the migration chain plus Razorpay financial failure/retry scenarios.
