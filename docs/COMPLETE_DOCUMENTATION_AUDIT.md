## Current project reality

The repository is an operational single npm Next.js application, not the planned pnpm/Turborepo monorepo described in several documents. It uses root-level `app/`, `src/`, and `prisma/` directories; Next.js 16; React 19; Prisma; Tailwind v4; and six API handlers.

Working capabilities include public pages, registration/login/email verification/password reset, basic profile setup, marketplace discovery, dashboard data, and selected portal screens. The app is buildable, but it does not yet implement the planned marketplace architecture in full.

## Document conflicts that must be resolved

1. **Phase definition:** the BRD, SRS, and master scope describe platform feature parity across web, iOS, and Android. ADR-001 and the architecture document prescribe web first and Flutter in Phase 2.
2. **Payments:** the BRD/SRS defer platform payments to Phase 2, while `CLAUDE.md`, the architecture document, and delivery plan treat escrow as required before web launch.
3. **Architecture:** planning documents describe `apps/web`, `packages/core`, `packages/db`, `packages/contracts`, PostGIS, `/api/v1`, OpenAPI, and RS256 access/refresh tokens. The current repository has none of these structures or controls.
4. **Launch market:** most newer documents propose Canada and CAD, but some examples use Surat. The launch country, cities, currency, and tax scope require one approved decision.
5. **Messaging and notifications:** some documents defer them to Phase 2, while the architecture describes chat and Web Push at V1.
6. **Verification access:** documents disagree on whether verification documents are retrievable by their professional owner or admin-only after upload.

The approved [product baseline](product-baseline.md) is the temporary resolution record. Update the source planning documents to point to it once a product owner signs it off.

## Important gaps between plan and code

- No versioned `/api/v1` API, OpenAPI contract, or consistent structured error envelope.
- No framework-independent service layer; several route handlers contain database and business logic.
- Current auth is an HS256, seven-day HTTP-only cookie session. It is not the planned access/refresh token design.
- No automated tests, CI quality gates, API contract validation, privacy tests, or end-to-end tests.
- No PostGIS/GeoRepository, location obfuscation, or database-enforced coordinate privacy boundary.
- No secure storage/upload pipeline, document-review workflow, audit log, background-job queue, Sentry integration, or security-header policy.
- No Stripe, wallet, escrow, payout, or payment-webhook implementation.
- Required public About, Contact, Privacy Policy, and Terms pages are missing.

## What already aligns well

- TypeScript uses `strict` and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`.
- No active `any`, TypeScript ignore directives, or user-facing Server Actions were found.
- The project uses a shared Prisma client and server-side session checks.
- Tailwind v4 tokens, shadcn/Radix components, and the design-system visual language are largely present.
- Linting and production build pass.

## Approved implementation order

1. Obtain sign-off on `docs/product-baseline.md`.
2. Record the actual repository architecture and align the planning documents.
3. Add tests, CI, environment validation, backups, and non-destructive security improvements.
4. Introduce service boundaries, stable `/api/v1` routes, OpenAPI, DTOs, and standard errors without breaking current routes.
5. Upgrade authentication and authorization with a reviewed token/session migration plan.
6. Implement profile, media, verification, admin, jobs, discovery, quotes, hiring, and work tracking in approved milestones.
7. Implement PostGIS and badge derivation only after data-migration and product-policy approval.
8. Implement payments only after legal and Stripe-flow approval.
9. Complete accessibility, privacy, performance, monitoring, UAT, and launch readiness.

## Documentation recommendation

Keep the source documents for reference, but do not treat every file as equally authoritative. Maintain these active documents in the root `docs/` folder:

- `product-baseline.md` — signed product and phase decisions
- `current-architecture.md` — actual implemented architecture
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — approved build sequence
- `COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md` — this audit

Archive or clearly label superseded planning documents. Do not delete the source documents or database models without explicit approval and a verified backup/migration plan.
