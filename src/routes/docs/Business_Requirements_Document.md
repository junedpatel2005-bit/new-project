## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The business intends to launch a two-sided service marketplace connecting **Clients** (individuals and businesses needing work done) with **Professionals** (tradespeople, freelancers, and service providers). The platform is location-aware: jobs and professionals are matched partly by geography, using Google Maps for job location, service radius, and distance.

The platform will be delivered across three surfaces — responsive **web portal**, **iOS app**, and **Android app** — with feature parity across all three for both user types.

Delivery is split into two phases. **Phase 1** establishes the marketplace core: registration, verified professional profiles, job posting, discovery, hiring, work tracking, and reviews. **Phase 2** adds on-platform payments, in-app messaging, and the full notification set.

Revenue is generated through a commission deducted from professional earnings. *[Commission model TO BE CONFIRMED — see section 12.]*

## 2. BUSINESS OBJECTIVES

| ID | Objective | Success measure |
|---|---|---|
| BO-01 | Establish a trusted marketplace where clients can find and hire verified local professionals | *[TO BE CONFIRMED — e.g. verified professionals onboarded in first 6 months]* |
| BO-02 | Give professionals a channel to find work near them and manage jobs end to end | *[TO BE CONFIRMED — e.g. active professionals, jobs per professional per month]* |
| BO-03 | Build trust through document verification and a public review system | Ratio of Fully Verified professionals; average rating; dispute rate |
| BO-04 | Generate revenue via commission on completed jobs | Take rate; gross merchandise value |
| BO-05 | Reach market quickly with a functional Phase 1, deferring payment complexity | Phase 1 live by *[TO BE CONFIRMED]* |

## 3. BUSINESS NEED AND PROBLEM STATEMENT

Clients seeking skilled trade and professional services currently rely on word of mouth, classified listings, and unverified directories. They have no reliable way to confirm that a provider holds a valid licence, carries insurance, or has passed a background check, and no structured way to compare quotes or track work.

Professionals face the mirror problem: no low-cost channel to reach clients near them, no way to signal credentials credibly, and no structured tool to manage quotes, job progress, and payment.

The platform addresses both by combining **verified credentials**, **location-based matching**, and a **structured hiring and delivery workflow** in one product.
