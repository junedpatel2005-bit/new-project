# SCOPE OF DEVELOPMENT — MASTER DOCUMENT

**Merged from:** `Scope Of Development.docx` (full scope) + `Scope Of Development-Phase-1.docx`

Every feature from both documents appears below. Nothing has been dropped. Each line carries a phase tag so one document can serve as the single source of truth.

## Legend

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **[P1]** | In Phase 1 — present in both source documents |
| **[P2]** | Phase 2 — in the full scope, removed from Phase 1 |
| **[FUTURE]** | Explicitly marked "Future Scope" in the source document |
| **⚠** | Conflict or dependency gap — see *Open Decisions* at the end of this document |

**Platforms:** All client-side and professional-side features apply to the **Website Portal**, **iOS App**, and **Android App** unless stated otherwise.

# 5) OPEN DECISIONS — RESOLVE BEFORE DEVELOPMENT STARTS

The Phase-1 cuts were not applied consistently. These five points must be settled or the developer will make the call for you.

### Decision 1 — Money in vs. money out

All client payment features were cut from Phase 1, but the professional's **Earnings & Wallet** (withdraw money, pending payouts, invoices, commission deduction) and **Request milestone payment** were kept, along with the **Payment released** notification.

**Options:** (a) bring client payments into Phase 1, or (b) move the whole wallet to Phase 2 and let Phase 1 handle payment off-platform.
**Decision:** ______________________

### Decision 2 — How a proposal becomes a hire

Professionals can still *Apply to jobs* and *Add quote* in Phase 1, but the client's *Receive proposals* and *Accept / reject proposal* were cut — while *Hire professional* stayed. There is no path from a proposal to a hire. Also note *Apply to jobs* and *Send proposal* are the same action written twice; keep one label.

**Recommendation:** Move *Receive proposals* and *Accept / reject proposal* into Phase 1.
**Decision:** ______________________

### Decision 3 — Negotiation without chat

*Chat before hiring* and both *Message received* notifications were cut from Phase 1, but the professional's *Negotiate if needed* remains. Negotiation needs a channel.

**Options:** (a) add basic in-app chat to Phase 1, (b) allow revised quotes only, (c) drop negotiation from Phase 1.
**Decision:** ______________________

### Decision 4 — Disputes with no remedy

Client *Report issue* and *Raise dispute* stayed in Phase 1, but *Request refund / dispute* left with the payment section. Define what a Phase-1 dispute actually does — most likely an admin ticket with no financial action.
**Decision:** ______________________

### Decision 5 — One-sided notifications

Professional notifications were kept almost in full; client notifications were removed entirely. This looks like an oversight. At minimum the client needs *Professional hired*, *Job completed*, and *Review request*.
**Decision:** ______________________

---

# 6) ITEMS PENDING FROM CLIENT

- **Service / job category list** — referenced in three places (job posting, client discovery filter, professional discovery filter) and marked "will share at a later stage." Blocks database schema and filter UI.
- **Commission / fee structure** — the public *Pricing / Fees / Commission* page and the professional's *platform commission deduction* both need the actual numbers.

---

# 7) NOT COVERED IN EITHER DOCUMENT

Neither source document mentions the following. Flagging so they are priced deliberately rather than assumed:

- **Admin panel / back office** — yet verification requires someone to approve or reject documents, and disputes require someone to resolve them. Phase 1 cannot function without at least a basic admin.
- Multi-language support
- Analytics / reporting
- Content management for the public website pages
- Non-functional requirements: expected user load, browser and OS version support, data residency
